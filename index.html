        <div class="subheading mb-5">Art Studio</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Frida Jimenez. I currently attend the University of Riverside, California (UCR), however, I am originally from San Diego, California. I continued my studies in order to advance my knowledge and skills on the subject of Art. Art has always been a major highlight of my life for as long as I can remember. I participate in any form of media, but I focus mainly on traditional art with a sketchbook and pencil. At the moment, I am not sure where I plan to take my studies too, whether it’s to work as an artist in animations or so. I’m strongly motivated by those around me and my desire to achieve my goals to succeed. Though motivation is important to have, it’s also true that distractions are bound to occur. When I am confronted with distractions, I find it difficult to complete any tasks. Therefore, I focus specifically on my tasks, and plan out how and what I need to do to complete it. <br><br>

        Studying art has truly been an amazing experience. Though I love the subject I’ve never had the opportunity to genuinely dive into the concept. I’ve now come to understand some of the most inspirational icons in art and what it takes to reach my peak of creativity. Even though I mainly focus on creating art in the form of drawing, I also dwell in different media such as painting and photography. It’s great to expand your knowledge on other materials and never limit yourself from what you think you should only focus on. Throughout my life, I’ve always imagined myself mainly focusing on one thing in specific, but by allowing myself the chance to seek new ideas, I learned how much more I can grow. I learned how I can find new likes and dislikes. Taking time off and focusing on yourself is key for your growth mentally and physically. I find it pleasing and effective when I focus on myself and no one else. I’m able to understand myself on a different level and block any distractions. I’ve only started college yet I feel even more confident in my ability to grow.<br><br>

         As I continue my journey throughout college, I hope to grow and mature as a person in order to reach a desired state, mentally and physically. Working collaboratively and cooperatively truly benefits my social skills and allows me to meet new people. For as long as I can remember, socializing was never easy for me. However, college gave me the opportunity to open up and let go of my comfort zone. On the other hand, it’s been a great experience meeting new people because it allowed me to learn more than what I know about myself. I was able to expand my knowledge on cultural differences and general needs. I was never fully committed to college. During my final year of high school, I constantly found myself wondering whether I was truly choosing the right path or not for my future. It takes dedication and motivation to fully commit to anything.
